			<h1>⋆⭒˚⋆Putting Stoicism into practice⋆⭒˚⋆</h1>
			
			<p><center>Here is a list of some of the most common exercices and practices used in Stoicism. There are obviously many more but these are the essential ones that correspond with the main principles of this philosophy.</center></p>

			<h2>♜ Journaling</h2>
			<img src="images/hercules sketch.png" class="right-image"/>
			<p>Seneca’s favorite time to journal was in the evenings. When darkness had fallen and his wife had gone asleep, he explained to a 
			friend, “I examine my entire day and go back over what I’ve done and said, hiding nothing from myself, passing nothing by.” Then he
		 	would go to bed, finding that “the sleep which follows this self-examination” was particularly sweet. In Stoicism the art of 
			journaling is more than some simple diary. This daily practice is the philosophy. Preparing for the day ahead. Reflecting on the day
			 that has passed. Reminding oneself of the wisdom we have learned from our teachers, from our reading, from our own experiences. 
			 It’s not enough to simply hear these lessons once, instead, one practices them over and over again, turns them over in their mind,
			and most importantly, writes them down and feels them flowing through their fingers in doing so.</p>

			<h2>Dichotomy of control ♜</h2>

			<p>The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t. 
				What we have influence over and what we do not. We spend a large part of our lives trying to change these things we have no 
				control over, leading to no results and a lot of wasted time and effort that could have been invested in the things we do 
				have control over. No matter how hard you try, you can't please everyone.
				No matter how hard you wish for it, you can't change your height or be born in a different country. 

				Return to this question daily—in each and every trying situation. Journal and reflect on it constantly. If you can focus on 
				making clear what parts of your day are within your control and what parts are not, you will not only be happier, 
				you will also be able to save a lot of time and spend it on things that can actually harbor change.</p>			

			<h2>♜ Practicing misfortune (a.k.a gratitude)</h2>
			<p>Seneca, who enjoyed great wealth as the adviser of Nero, suggested that we ought to set aside a certain number of days each month
				to practice poverty. Take a little food, wear your worst clothes, get away from the comfort of your home and bed. Put yourself 
				face to face with want, and you'll find yourself being forced to feel grateful for your situation. We may always want more and
				look to those above us, but we must remember there are thousands who would kill to be in our position and are doing far worse
				than us. This exercise is quite similar to the holy month of Ramadan where muslims restrict themselves form food and water 
				from sunrise to sunset for a whole month. This holy month is a chance for believers to put themselves in the shoes of the 
				poor and be grateful for the blessings they have been given. </p>

			<h2>Memento mori: "Remember you will die" ♜</h2>
			<img src="images/fighting snakes statue.png" class="left-image"/>
			<p>None of this is going to last. None of it has any meaning: the anger, the sadness, the achievements...it's all ephemereal. 
				In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius wrote that “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say 
				and think.” That was a personal reminder to continue living a life of virtue now, and not wait.
				If everything is ephemeral though, what does matter? Right now matters. Being a good person and doing the right thing right now, that’s what matters 
				and that’s what was important to the Stoics. Be humble and honest and aware. That is something you can have every single day of 
				your life.</p>
			
			<h2>♜ Premeditatio molarum</h2>
			<p>The premeditatio malorum (“the pre-meditation of evils”) is a Stoic exercise of imagining things that could go wrong or be taken away 
				from us. It helps us prepare for life’s inevitable setbacks. We don’t always get what is rightfully ours, even if we’ve earned it. 
				Not everything is as clean and straightforward as we think they may be. Psychologically, we must prepare ourselves for this to happen. 
				Therefore imagining worst-case scenarios or potential losses helps you appreciate what you have and prepare for challenges that may come your way.
				It is one of the most powerful exercise in the Stoics’ toolkit to build resilience and strength.</p>

			<h2>Amor Fati ♜</h2>
			<img src="images/ladies statue.png" class="right-image"/>
			<p>The great German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche would describe his formula for human greatness as amor fati—a love of fate. 
				The Stoics were not only familiar with this attitude but they embraced it. Two thousand years ago, Epictetus, who as a crippled 
				slave has faced adversity after adversity, said: <i>“Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that 
				what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy.”</i>
				It is why amor fati is the Stoic exercise and mindset that you take on for making the best out of anything that happens: 
				Treating each and every moment—no matter how challenging—as something to be embraced, not avoided. To not only be okay with it, 
				but love it too.</p>
