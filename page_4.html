			<h2>♝ Managing stress</h2>
			
			<p>By applying the dichotomy of control and negative visualisation, individuals learn to focus on the parts of their life they 
				can control and let go of what they can't as well as prepare mentally for challenges and reduce their fear of the unknown. 
				this helps reduce stress and anxiety.</p>			

			<h2>Improving focus + productivity ♝</h2>
			<p>Stoicism emphasizes staying present and focused on the task at hand. Practicing mindfulness can improve concentration and
				efficiency in work and daily activities. By aligning actions with core values (wisdom, courage, justice, temperance),
				 individuals can make better decisions and maintain a sense of purpose, enhancing overall productivity and satisfaction.</p>
			
			<h2>♝ Enhancing relationships</h2>
			
			<p>Stoics believe in understanding others' perspectives and responding with compassion rather than judgment. 
				This approach can improve interpersonal relationships and communication. Stoicism also encourages emotional regulation, 
				therefore byy recognizing that emotions arise from judgments, individuals can practice rational responses, avoiding 
				impulsive reactions that may harm relationships.</p>

			<h2>Dealing with adversity ♝</h2>
			<p>Stoic practices like negative visualization and acceptance of fate (amor fati) help individuals develop mental toughness
				and adaptability in the face of challenges. Viewing hardships as opportunities for growth and character development can
				transform how individuals perceive and handle adversity.</p>

			<h2>♝ Stoicism in Psychology</h2>
			<h3>♟ Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
			<p>CBT, developed by Aaron T. Beck, shares many principles with Stoicism, such as the idea that our thoughts influence our emotions and behaviors. 
				By changing negative thought patterns, individuals can improve their mental health. CBT techniques like identifying cognitive distortions 
				(e.g., catastrophizing, black-and-white thinking) and practicing rational responses are deeply rooted in Stoic philosophy.</p>

			<h3>♟ Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</h3>
			<p>This therapy encourages accepting thoughts and feelings rather than fighting them, aligning closely with Stoic acceptance of external events 
				and focusing on values-driven actions. In addition, modern mindfulness practices, which encourage staying present and non-judgmental, resonate with Stoic teachings on maintaining focus and emotional balance.</p>
