			<h2>Dictionary definition:</h2>
			<h3><b>Stoicism</b></h3>
			<p>/ˈstəʊɪsɪz(ə)m/</p>
			<p>noun: <b>stoicism</b>; noun: <b>Stoicism</b></p>
			<ol>
				<li>The endurance of pain or hardship without the display of feelings and without complaint.</li>
				<li>An ancient Greek school of philosophy founded at Athens by Zeno of Citium. The school taught that virtue, the highest good, is based on knowledge; the wise live in harmony with the divine Reason (also identified with Fate and Providence) that governs nature, and are indifferent to the vicissitudes of fortune and to pleasure and pain.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>What is it actually though?</h2>
			<p> Stoicism, or Stoic philosophy, is a Hellenistic philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BCE. It is a philosophy of personal ethics and a methodology for seeking practical wisdom in life. A key principle of the ancient Stoics was the belief that we don’t react to events; we react to our judgments about them, and the judgments are up to us. They also advised that we should not worry about things beyond our control as everything in life can be divided into two categories – things that are under our control and things that are out of it. In simple terms, Stoicism teaches us to focus on the things we can control—our character, thoughts, emotions, and actions—while accepting the things we cannot, such as the actions of others or the natural course of events going on in the world around us. If we can learn to do this, we can learn to develop a more resilient mindset.</p>

			<h2>History of stoicism: origins and developement</h2>
		
			<p>Stoicism was founded by <b>Zeno of Citium</b> in <b>Athens</b> around <b>300 BC</b>. The name is derived from the <b>“Stoa Poikile”</b> (“Painted Porch”) where Zeno taught from. Stoicism moved to Rome where it flourished during the period of the Empire, alternatively being persecuted by Emperors who disliked it (for example, <b>Vespasian</b> and <b>Domitian</b>) and openly embraced by Emperors who attempted to live by it (most prominently <b>Marcus Aurelius</b>). It was one of the major schools of philosophy from the <b>Hellenistic</b> period through to the <b>Roman</b> era. It influenced Christianity, as well as a number of major philosophical figures throughout the ages (for example, <b>Thomas More, Descartes, Spinoza</b>).
				The history of Stoicism is usually divided into three phases: </p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Early Stoa:</b> Zeno of Citium founded the school in Athens. His successors, Cleanthes and Chrysippus, further developed Stoic doctrines, particularly on logic and ethics.</li>
				<li><b>Middle Stoa:</b> This period saw the blending of Stoic philosophy with other traditions. Key figures include Panaetius and Posidonius, who introduced Stoicism to Rome and influenced Roman thinkers.</li>
				<li><b>Late Stoa:</b> This period includes influential Roman Stoics like Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Their works provide practical advice on applying Stoic principles to daily life.</li>
