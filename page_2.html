			<h2>Core idea of Stoicism ♛</h2>
			<img src="images/angel statue.png" class="right-image"/>
			<p>At its core, Stoicism is two things:</p>	
			<ul>
				<li>A set of ethical values that helps us reach a virtuous life and a state of being marked by happiness, resilience, and peace of mind from doing good. These principles also help us avoid guilt, anger, jealousy, hatred, and other negative emotions through the avoidance of evil (more on this later).</li>
				<li>A set of practices that teach us to reduce our stress and negative emotions by cultivating self-awareness, discipline, wisdom, and rationality. It also encourages us to align ourselves with nature.</li>
			</ul>		

			<h2>♛ The four cardinal virtues</h2>
			<p>Therefore the guiding principles, or ethical values, of Stoicism can be distilled into four cardinal virtues:</p>
				<p>♟ <b>Wisdom</b> – our ability to see things as they are, free from bias, and prejudice. Wisdom is our ability to see right from wrong, use reason, rational judgement, and avoid warping the truth of what we see.</p>
				<p>♟ <b>Courage</b> – our ability to act in alignment with what we think is right, despite pressure not to.</p>
				<p>♟ <b>Justice</b> – our capacity to behave in the interests of the common and wider good. The opposite of this would be to behave in ways that are detrimental to our neighbours and fellow man.</p>
				<p>♟ <b>Temperance</b> – our ability to exercise self restraint, self control, moderation, and discipline.</ul></p>
			
			<p>Similar to the Socratic  branch of philosophy, the Stoics believed that virtue is the sole good and vice the sole evil, a view prevalent among Greek philosophies of the era. Consequently, this means that the quality of our character is the most important thing.
				By cultivating virtues and adhering to Stoic ethics, the Stoics believed we could become better individuals, live our best lives, develop resilience, and achieve happiness and contentment through good character. Stoicism teaches that external goods (wealth, health, reputation) are indifferent; they do not contribute to a person's moral character.</p>
			
			<h2>The Stoic dichotomy of control ♛</h2>
			<blockquote>
				To achieve freedom and happiness, you need to grasp this basic truth: some things in life are under your control, and others are not.
				Within your control are your own opinions, aspirations, desires, and the things that repel you. We always have a choice about the contents and character of our inner lives.
				Not within your control is literally everything else. You must remember these things are externals, and none of your concern.
				<cite>– Epictetus</cite>
			</blockquote>

			<p>The Stoics believed that a fundamental key to reducing suffering and living a good life is to make a clear distinction between that which is within our complete control and that which is not. As we come closer to understanding this distinction, we can begin to focus our energy and time on what we can influence and accept what we cannot instead of wasting time on it. The concept of control is not unique to the Stoics; it has risen to prominence across multiple cultures throughout history as a method for living a more aware and fulfilling life, from Buddhists to Hebrews to feudal Japan to ancient Greeks.</p>
			
			<h2>♛ Memento mori</h2>
			<p>Memento mori is a Latin phrase meaning "remember that you will die." It is a concept and practice that serves as a reminder of the inevitability of death, encouraging people to reflect on their mortality. The idea is to promote a focus on the ephemeral nature of life, prompting individuals to live more meaningfully and virtuously. This concept has been expressed through various art forms, literature, and philosophical reflections throughout history, often symbolized by imagery such as skulls, hourglasses, and decaying flowers. Memento mori underscores the transient nature of earthly pursuits and the importance of living a life that aligns with one's values and morals. When we recognize that our time is limited, we appreciate each moment more intently. When we are with loved ones, we don’t know how many moments like this we’ll have, so we become more present, focused, and grateful.</p>

			<h2>Amor fati ♛</h2>
			<p>Amor fati is a Latin phrase meaning "love of fate." It is a philosophical concept that encourages embracing everything that happens in life, including suffering and loss, as necessary and beneficial aspects of existence. Originating from Stoicism and later popularized by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, amor fati suggests that instead of merely accepting or enduring the events in our lives, we should actively love and embrace them.

				The idea behind amor fati is to cultivate an attitude that sees all experiences—good or bad—as integral to one's journey, fostering resilience and a positive outlook. By loving one's fate, individuals can find meaning and purpose in every circumstance, viewing challenges and adversities as opportunities for growth and self-improvement. This perspective helps in developing a harmonious relationship with life's ups and downs, leading to greater contentment and peace.</p>
